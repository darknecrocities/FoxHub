# FoxHub 🚀

## Overview 🌐

**FoxHub** is a unified platform designed to bridge the gap between education and career opportunities in the IT sector for college students, especially those from rural or provincial areas in the Philippines and other developing countries.

The platform empowers students by providing personalized IT career roadmaps, skill tracking, remote internship opportunities, and portfolio building tools — all accessible regardless of geographic location or bandwidth constraints.

## Problem Statement ❗

College students in IT-related programs face several barriers in accessing career-building opportunities:

1. **Limited Exposure to IT Career Paths** 💡  
   Most students only know generic roles like "web developer" or "IT support" and lack guidance on emerging fields such as AI/ML, cybersecurity, and DevOps.

2. **Geographic Inequality** 🌍  
   Students in urban centers have access to career fairs, internships, and tech events, while those in provinces are often left behind due to lack of remote internship offerings and limited local opportunities.

3. **Lack of Industry-Ready Preparation** 🛠️  
   Students often don't know which skills or projects to focus on, resulting in weak resumes and no centralized platform to showcase their work.

4. **Fragmented Tools and Resources** 📚  
   Learning resources, internship listings, and skill trackers are scattered across multiple platforms, creating confusion and inefficiency.
